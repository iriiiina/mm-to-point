# mm-to-pt | online converter
Small online converter that helps you to convert millimetres to typographical points of different standards and vice versa. From Artemy Lebedev's article [The life and extraordinary adventures of a typographical point](http://www.artlebedev.com/mandership/81/) you can find out that there are at least 3 different standards of typographical point used in different countries. So you may have a different results according to your location in the world:
* Didot: 1pt = 0.3759mm (Germany, Russia, Western Europe)
* Hawks: 1pt = 0.3514mm (USA, Great Britain)
* Fournier: 1pt = 0.364mm (France)
