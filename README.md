# mm-to-point
Small app that helps you to convert millimetres to typographical points of different standards and vice versa. From Artemy Lebedev's article [The life and extraordinary adventures of a typographical point](http://www.artlebedev.com/mandership/81/) you can find out that there are at least 3 different standards of typographical point for historical reasons:
* Didot: 1pt = 0.3759mm
* Hawks: 1pt = 0.3514mm
* Fournier: 1pt = 0.364mm
